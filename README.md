# SaltyNX

Sysmodule for injecting custom codes into retail games, by default it injects "Core" which includes many useful features known as NX-FPS (tracking game performance statistics, unlocking FPS) and ReverseNX-RT (switching between docked and handheld graphics profiles). Sysmodule also manages custom refresh rates in both handheld and docked modes.

This sysmodule targets more common approach, so basic compatibility with all games is a priority. If you want to inject code for specific game I recommend much more powerful code injection framework - [exlaunch](https://github.com/shadowninja108/exlaunch).

Original sysmodule was created by: https://github.com/shinyquagsire23

This fork includes many new features (aforementioned NX-FPS and ReverseNX-RT), compatibility fixes, and beside plugins support also supports patches for easy way to edit common functions.

# Thanks to
- `Cooler3D` for sharing code with me how he was changing handheld display refresh rate in his tools that were first publicly available tools allowing this on HOS. I have used that as basis to make my own function.
